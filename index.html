            The key difference between the two recomandations is that <strong>W3C</strong> would rather focus on creating a semantic web where the information could be accessed even easier. On the other hand, <strong>WHATWG</strong> didn't view the Web solely as a source of information, but an environment where different types of content and software could interact, therefore creating uncountable more ways in which the Web could used, besides a way to receive and send information.

            The internet connects a computer to other computers in order to transmit content.<br>
            The World-Wide-Web is software which allows that content to be created or used.

           <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> adds semantic meaning - representing an emphasized span of text. It can also be stylized in CSS afterwards. <br>
          <b>&lt;bold&gt;</b> It bolds the text without adding extra meaning or importance. Also it won't be recognizable by applications used by blind people.<br>
          <i>&lt;italics&gt;</i>Same as for bold, italics does not have semantic meaning; while <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> has the same relationship with italics as strong has with bold.

      One of the differences between <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> elements is that <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> is a Block-Level element (always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available), while <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> is an Inline Element (does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary)

      The pro of using the <code>iframe</code> tag is actually its main purpose: to access a page or content of it on another page without having to access it separately. On the other hand, it has multiple disadvantages, namely:  
        <p>
                <strong>Linking/Bookmarks:</strong> Without using extra JavaScript, if a user wants to share the content of an <code>iframe</code>, it would be difficult to extract the link of the content. For example, if someone would browse through the <code>iframe</code> content, and he would like to share a page other than the one the <code>iframe</code> starts with, whatever link he sends to his friend wouldn't matter, because the received link would show the beginning state of the <code>iframe</code> content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Debugging is difficult: </strong> Often, bugs can be replicated when a page is within the <code>iframe</code>, while outside the <code>iframe</code> it runs buttery smooth. Then the problem rises if the bug is inside the <code>iframe</code> or outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Difficult to sustain: </strong> due to frequent misuse or overuse: it's difficult to maintain stability of it once errors occur, since, as said earlier, hardships occur when debbuging <code>iframes</code>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Unreliable for Search Engine Optimisation: </strong> Even though recent tests might prove otherwise, it is still unclear whether SEO is affected by the usage of <code>iframe</code> (some search engines might not detect the content of an <code>iframe</code>, so, for example if someone would search for, let's say, "bananas and pineaples", and my page has an <code>iframe</code> containing the homepage of <a href="http://www.chiquita.com/Home.aspx">Chiquita</a>, my page is likely to rank lower in search results, due to the fact that the content of the <code>iframe</code> might not be taken into consideration by the search engine. )

        Potential benefits of using <strong>CSS</strong>:
          
            
              <p>
              <strong>Viewing Options:</strong> CSS allows for the same markup page to be shown in different viewing styles (i.e.: different style sheets for different resolutions, such as mobile devices, print, etc.).
            </p>
              
              <p>
              <strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimisation): </strong> CSS is an easy code to read, therefore it won't interfere with SEO, in a sence that it will leave more content and less code for the search engine to analyze.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              <strong>Consistency: </strong> One of, if not the best attribute of CSS, is that changing the stylesheet of one page, can automatically change the stylesheet of multiple pages of your website, saving time and lowering the possibility of typos, bugs, etc.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              <strong>Bandwith Efficiency: </strong> The CSS document is stored externally, usually being linked with multiple pages of a website, thus eliminating duplicates, lowering the size of the files, therefore the loading times and the bandwith used.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
              <strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> CSS increases your website adaptability and ensure that more people will view your website the way you intended.
              </p>
        
      </li>
        
        <li>
            There will be no visual difference between the emphasized word and the rest of the paragraph (with italic font style), because both <code>em</code> tag and <em>italic</em> font style have the same visual representation, the difference being that <code> em </code> tag will add semantic value to the text inside of it, while the text in <em>italic</em> will lack any of it.
      </li>

            When comparing <strong>Google Chrome</strong> with <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, the key advantages of Chrome range from better software optimisation: including higher responsiveness, lower loading times, fewer bugs. Also, the third party plug-ins and apps support is an important part of Chrome's supremacy, almost as big as the implementation of the Google ecosystem into the browser (native support for Gmail, Google Maps, Google Earth, etc.). On the other hand, Internet Explorer, even with its flaws, has a better compatibility (with older verisions of Windows, etc.), lower RAM memory usage, and is the source of a lot of jokes that I hope will continue next year, in 2013, also.

            According to the WCAG guideline, the problem of missing ALT texts for images can be linked to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-equiv">Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives</a>, which states that "<em> All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations...</em>" such as <strong>Time-Based Media, Controls, Input, etc.</strong>

            Because <a href="google.com">Google</a> is hands-down the most used search engine worldwide, we found it is well optimized in terms of accessibility, even if the test highlighted 2 errors, they do not interfere with the page's functionality, nor accessibilty (e.g.: one of the errors says that the button for the Google Apps tray is "a link that contains no text", while the element has its description in the title).

              We picked 3 pairs of colours:
                <a href="https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=154733,bg=333333">Olive Green and Grey</a>, <a href="https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=FFFFFF,bg=000000">Black and White</a> and <a href="https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=FFFF47,bg=000000">Yellow and Black</a> and we observed the following facts:
Brightness Difference is directly proportional to Color Difference. Usually, when difference in brightness is large, the difference in color is also large. This creates better contrast. 
Saturation seems to affect contrast between two colours to a great extent - a less saturated colour will contrast well with a very saturated colour.

Browsers do not display pages pixel by pixel, instead they interpret code. However, browsers interpret the W3C standards differently, resulting that both HTML and CSS is rendered differently across browsers.

            First of all, the key advantage of running a <strong>Native app</strong> in favour of a <strong>Web App</strong> is the fact that it can run even when there's no Internet connection. On the other hand, a <strong>Web app</strong> doesn't require any local storage, as it doesn't need to install on one's device, since it runs within the web page.

            <strong>Internationalization</strong> represents a design process that ensures that a software application can be accesed from anywhere in the world, without encoutering problems based on <em>language, alphabet, region</em>. With Internet being at the core the ideal medium for sharing information, there should not be any barriers that could make the access to information harder for anyone.

            The IP address of <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl">few.vu.nl</a> is 130.37.164.154; same as the IP of <a href="www.cs.vu.nl">cs.vu.nl</a>. The way we found the answer was by opening a command prompt and testing the ping of both web pages. This returned the ping statistics which show the <strong>RTT(Round-Trip-Time)</strong> of sent and received packets. The lower the ping, the faster information is transmitted from host to computer - and thus, the faster a web page can load. 
        </li>
        
        
        <li>
            <strong>IP(Internet Protocol)</strong> represents the addressing scheme for devices to communicate over a network: every device has it's own individual one. In recent years, the number of computers, smartphones, etc. that are connected to the Internet has grown worringly fast, the problem of running out of IP addresses becoming a bigger one, due to the fact that <strong>IPv4</strong> is using 32-bit addressing, therefore allowed for a (mere) total of 2^32 addresses (approx 4 billion). The answer of this problem was solved with a new version of IP: <strong>IPv6</strong>, which is using 128-bit addressing, resulting in a whopping <strong>2^128</strong> or <strong>3.4*10^38</strong> addresses, more than enough to satisfy our need for connectivity.<br>
                Also, besides solving the address problem, <strong>IPv6</strong>supported other important changes meant to improve the IP protocol, such as: 
            
            <div id="ipv6">
            
                <p>
                    <strong>Discontinuing the Usage of NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong>, therefore improving peer-to-peer performance.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Improved Autoconfiguring ability</strong>, by offering <strong>simple, automatic</strong> configuration.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Simplified Packet Header Structures</strong>, improving performance in routing by lowering the time required for header proccessing.
                </p>
            
            
                <p>
                    <strong>Built-in Authentication and Privacy Support (IPSec): IPSec</strong> contains a set of cryptographic protocols used for ensuring <strong>secure data communication </strong> and <strong>key exchange</strong>.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    <strong>Easier Network Administration</strong> by making <em>network renumbering</em> able to execute automatically.
                </p>
                
                <p>

            <strong>MIME</strong> types are labels assigned to different types of data, allowing software to recognize and handle the data accordingly. It serves the same purpose on the internet that file extensions do on Microsoft Windows. 
            Most common subtypes of type text are .txt (plain text); .css (written in css language); .html (written in html language). <a href=”http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml”>More info</a>.

                Request method is usually either <strong>GET or POST.</strong>
                When submitting a form on a website, the request might sometimes be “POST”, but can also be “GET”.
                However, when clicking on a link, or accessing bookmarks - the request is always “GET”.
                Thus, when a “POST” request is sent, it is clear that a form had been submitted.

            In <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, the console is accesible in multiple ways: you can either open DevTools ("F12") and then select the "Console" panel, or simply press <strong>Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows / Linux) or Cmd+Opt+J (Mac)</strong>.

                First and foremost, the approaches chosen to change the default behaviour differs between the 2 cases: while the method "<em>element.<strong>removeAttribute</strong>.(att)</em>" used by us <strong>must specify explicitly</strong> which attribute suffers a change (by brute force), "<em>event.<strong>preventDefault()</strong></em>" is a more elegant and efficient (lower chance of error: typo, incorect syntax, etc.) way of overriding the behaviour of an element. On the other hand, "<em>element.<strong>removeAttribute</strong></em>" has an advantage in a way that it's more flexible than it's counterpart.

                 The main difference between <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> is that <strong>Python</strong> is a general scripting language, which can sometimes be used for server-side programming, <strong>JavaScript</strong>'s solely use is for building interactivity on web pages: Javascript is an interpreted language; Python also can be compiled into byte code. In addition, while JavaScript follows C syntax patterns, Python's simplified, more human-like syntax makes it easier to learn and reduces the in-code error frequency.
                
                On the other hand, there are similarities, too: both languages support a programming design that utilizes straightforward functions as well as variables without engaging in class meanings; Memory is managed by garbage collection.

            "<strong>AJAX</strong>" stands for <strong>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</strong>. It's most appealing feature comes from the first "A" (Asynchronous) in it's name, which means that it can make requests to the server without having to reload the page.

                <strong>Host objects</strong> are objects that are supplied to JavaScript by the <strong>browser environment</strong>. Therefore, they <strong>do not</strong> have any equivalents in general scripting languages (e.g. Java, Python). For example, "<em>window</em>" and "<em>document</em>" are host objects.

                <strong>Native objects</strong> are supplied JavaScript, not by the browser or user. "<em>String</em>" and "<em>Boolean</em>" are two examples of native objects.

                <strong>Events</strong>, as the name says, are "things" that happen to HTML elements, like: hovering, clicking, page fully loaded, etc. 
                
                <strong>Event Listeners</strong> allow JavaScript code to run at the happening of an event ("Join the red team", remember?)

                The autocomplete component is a really useful widget that can be added to an Webpage or mobile app, helping the user by processing the input in real-time and displying predictions of what the final search input might be.  The constructor takes two arguments: an HTML <em>input</em> element and an "<strong>OPTIONS</strong>" argument, through which different adjustments can be set over the resulted predictions (filter by area, by type (address, region, geocode, ect.) set bounds, retrieve only IDs). 
                
            
                While for most of the users Autocomplete widget might be just a two seconds-saver, in some cases it might be way more than that: let's say that someone is lost in an foreign place and doesn't remember his/hers Hotel's full name, then this widget can 
                prove to be very useful.

The tokenizer only performs the basic function of splitting and separating words. It doesn’t deal well with punctuation. For example, hyphens are disregarded, but words are also split (for example: “Tea-Party” is considered as two separate words “tea” and “party”) In order to improve the tokenizer. Implementing an english word library would help. Also, certain preprocessing methods would prove useful: 
A function that disregards symbols contained within words - while connecting words instead of splitting them apart
A function that discards elements containing single characters such as “t” or “s”
A stemming function that abbreviates words such as “little” to “littl”
</p>
         
            <p>
      b)  It doesn’t make sense to include them in a stop words list: it does not affect performance   to a high degree and this would greatly affect finding phrases which rely on common words in  order to convey meaning.

c) It is following Zipf’s law, as can be seen on the graph that’s displayed: The most frequent word “the” appears twice as many times as the second most frequent word “and” - and almost 3 times as third most frequent word - the pattern continues.
</p>
        
            <p>
d) Heaps law applies, as shown in the graph: The most common words are quickly encountered at the beginning, becoming increasingly difficult to find less frequent words.

The quality of the TF-based search is assessed via how relevant the query is compared to the given block of text. In our case the sought words come up many times in the highest ranked chapters, which are also the most closely associated to the query. Thus, precision is high - the most relevant chapters are ranked highest.
“Rabbit” - 1.96 in CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?
            “Hole” - 2.48 in CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
            “Tea” - 3.44 in CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party  
            Indeed, the sought words appear many times within the most relevant chapters, which are ranked highest. 
              </p>
        
            <p>
      c)  Precision would be higher since there would be fewer, but also relevant documents to retrieve.
              </p>
        
            <p>
      d) Precision and Recall would both improve given that the sought words would be more frequently found inside the documents - instead of being split or discarded.
